                        Eric Lorentzen is a 24-year old computer science student at Dunwoody College of Technology.  He is of Swedish heritage...a group not well known for producing or consuming whiskey (ughh).
                    He has, however, beaten his genetic predisposition for not consuming whiskey with many-a-blunt objects- and now enjoys American Rye Whiskey, Highland Scotch Whisky, as well as the occasional
                    elusive Corn Whiskey...when available.

                        Graham Rico-Johnson is a second year student at Dunwoody College of Technology. Although he is Italian and enjoys wine, his Irish heritage has created an unquenchable thirst for whiskey (Connoisseur or sorts, not a drunk).
                    He mostly enjoys smooth Irish whiskey, but has been recently venturing into the American bourbon territory. He is not too picky though, all whiskeys are welcome.
